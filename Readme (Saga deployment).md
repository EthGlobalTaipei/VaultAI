# Saga Chainlet Deployment

### Polygon Prize Requirements Met:
* Smart contract deployed to Saga Chainlet at address below:
  * `[Varad to enter in address]`
  * UI/Frontend exists (see http://chatdefi.app)

### Overview
[See Overview section at the top]

### Why Saga?
Successfully projects will be quickly constrained by scalability issues. Launching our project on Saga will guarantee chatDeFi easy horizontal scaling via its Chainlet architecture (i.e. each chatDeFi vault strategy can exist on its own chainlet). Also, fees are much more predictable since the Saga chainletâ€™s blockspace is not shared with other projects (whose sudden spike in popularity/usage often causes transaction fees to rise significantly).
